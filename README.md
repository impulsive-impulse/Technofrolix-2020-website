# Technofrolix-2020-website
Taking no credits away i must say i had help from DEEPAK TIWARI, my batchmate in the making of this website.
I must also mention that we didn't start from scratch, we had a previous messed up code to work upon which made the process WORSE.
The toughest part of programming is DEBUGGING someone else's code.
Finally i would say, It ain't much but it's honest work.
